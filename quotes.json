    "quote": "Good software practice requires such discipline(Total Productive Maintenance): focus, presence of mind, and thinking. It is not always just about doing, about pushing the factory equipment to produce at the optimal velocity. \nOne of the major pillars of TPM is the set of so-called 5S principles. \nSeiri, or organization (think “sort” in English). Knowing where things are—using approaches such as suitable naming—is crucial. \nSeiton, or tidiness (think “systematize” in English). There is an old American saying: A place for everything, and everything in its place. A piece of code should be where you expect to find it—and, if not, you should re-factor to get it there. \nSeiso, or cleaning (think “shine” in English): Keep the workplace free of hanging wires, grease, scraps, and waste. What do the authors here say about littering your code with comments and commented-out code lines that capture history or wishes for the future? Get rid of them. \nSeiketsu, or standardization: The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean. \nShutsuke, or discipline (self-discipline). This means having the discipline to follow the practices and to frequently reflect on one’s work and be willing to change.",
